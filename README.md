This app was made while reading the book Express Web Development.
This was started beginning chapter 2 and will continue to progress
as I read the succeeding chapters.


To start developing:
1.) Checkout the source code
2.) in the root directory of the app (where this readme and the package.json
file resides) run 'npm install' to get the necessary package dependencies.
    * Make sure your proxy is properly set.
    * to set the proxy, run:
        npm set config proxy http://login:password@proxy:port
        npm set config https-proxy http://login:password@proxy:port

Note: Directory structure might change

To Run the webserver, run the ff: in app root directory:
'npm start'

todo:
search for an excellent excel api for node to be added to the library app.
continue with book.

New way of cloning from github:
git clone http://username@github.com/repository.git
